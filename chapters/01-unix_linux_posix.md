# Unix, Linux, POSIX, and Beyond

Nowadays an applied mathematicians must utilize a computer in order to handle their workflow.
Computers must have an operating system(OS) and that is set in the stone. As to what OS
is optimal, there are no clear answers obviously. Every OS has its pros and cons. I adopted
the Unix-like(Unix, Linux, POSIX) OSs for now as I meticulously observed my mentors during my college years and still continue 
to do so. This chapter tries to help you determine whether you 
would benefit from those OSs too and if yes formulate a guideline for its learning process.

## Unix or not to Unix!

For now Unix is only a name and not a verb therefore making the heading a failed attempt at making a
witty remark. I however, hope that it someday makes its way to the standard dictionaries 
as a verb like grep or google. During my BSc, MSc, PhD years I observed my mentors and tried to 
have the same hardware, OS and softwares as a ay of minimizing the initial overhead of having a working 
workflow for my computing.

### BSc Years

I would say that in my BSc years there were only a handful of people that used Unix-like systems.
My trust in them however were so solid that I decided to follow their footsteps instead of the more
popular windows pathway. Here is a list and a short description of the nature of their computing works:

- Mir Abbas Jalali: Mechanical engineer professor but an applied mathematician at heart mostly
    doing complex physics simulation. Needed fast, high-performance low-level code(C, Fortran) to perform
    his computer experiments. Joined the CUDA party really fast back in 2010. Had an Apple, MacBook Pro with
    Darwin on top as the OS. Was willing to do cluster computing and parallelization if deemed worthy 
    monstrous computations done.
- Saeed Rezaei: A linguist professor that needed a lightweight with a 
  lasting battery daily driver to be able always on the move. Being able to edit 
  essays in different file formats like Markdown, \TeX . He wanted to stuff to work out of the box.     

### MSc Years

- Benjamin Berkels: double commander...jupyter notebook...math vs low level code...SSH...seminar...recording lecture videos.. 
- Paolo Bientinesi: low level programmerr...architecture aware software...SSH only...reallly realllyy big computing on monsterous machines...
- Goerg May: mathematician...lectures...integrity of the ipad macos...SSH code...

### PhD  Year

### Make a Choice

So look around and see if you make the same choice as I did...

## If not to Unix!

It might happen depending on the nature of your computing...then you can skippp the rest of the chapter and carry one with the rest of the book...
