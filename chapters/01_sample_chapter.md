# Unix, Linux, POSIX, and Beyond

Nowadays an applied mathematicians must utilize a computer in order to handle their workflow.
Computers must have an operating system(OS) and that is set in the stone. As to what OS
is optimal, there are no clear answers obviously. Every OS has its pros and cons. I adopted
the Unix-like(Unix, Linux, POSIX) OSs for now as I meticulously observed my mentors during my college years and still continue 
to do so. This chapter tries to help you determine whether you 
would benefit from those OSs too and if yes formulate a guideline for its learning process.
